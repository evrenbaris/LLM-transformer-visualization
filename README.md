# Transformer Visualization: Understand the Core of Modern AI

This repository provides an interactive and visual exploration of the **Transformer architecture**, which powers state-of-the-art models like **GPT**, **BERT**, and **T5**. By breaking down its key components into visual and intuitive examples, this project aims to make the architecture accessible to AI enthusiasts, students, and researchers.

 Why This Project?

Transformers revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by introducing the concept of **self-attention** and eliminating the need for recurrence. Despite their simplicity at the conceptual level, their inner workings can seem intimidating at first.

This project bridges the gap by:
- **Visualizing** core concepts like self-attention and positional encoding.
- Providing an **educational resource** to better understand the encoder-decoder framework.
- Offering interactive tools to experiment with Transformer internals.

   - Attention weights are displayed as an intuitive heatmap.

2. **Positional Encoding Visualization**:
   - Understand how sequence order is incorporated using sinusoidal patterns.
   - Visualized as heatmaps to highlight the encoding structure.

3. **Transformer Architecture Flow Diagram**:
   - Explore a high-level flowchart of the encoder-decoder framework.
   - See the connections between components like attention, feed-forward layers, and embeddings.
  
# How Transformers Work

### **1. Self-Attention Mechanism**
Self-Attention enables a model to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of an input sequence. For example:

In the sentence **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"**, the word **"jumps"** might attend more to **"fox"** (the subject).

This project visualizes these attention weights using a heatmap.

### **2. Positional Encoding**
Unlike RNNs, Transformers process sequences in parallel, so they lack inherent positional information. To address this:

- **Sinusoidal positional encodings** are added to word embeddings, encoding the position of each word in the sequence.

This project illustrates these encodings as heatmaps.

---

### **3. Encoder-Decoder Framework**
Transformers consist of:

- **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence into a meaningful representation.
- **Decoder**: Uses the encoder's output to generate the target sequence.

This project provides a flow diagram of the entire framework.
